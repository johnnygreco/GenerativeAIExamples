> 👋 **IMPORTANT** – Environment Setup
>
> - If you haven't already, follow the instructions in the [README](../../README.md) to install the necessary dependencies.
>
> - You may need to restart your notebook's kernel after setting up the environment.
>
> - In these notebooks, we assume you have a self-hosted instance of Data Designer up and running.
>
> - For deployment instructions, see the [Installation Options](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo/microservices/latest/design-synthetic-data-from-scratch-or-seeds/index.html#installation-options) section of the [NeMo Data Designer documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo/microservices/latest/design-synthetic-data-from-scratch-or-seeds/index.html).
